# RP makes heavy use of processes and threads.  Communication is normally
# established via ZMQ channels -- but specifically in the case of abnormal
# conditions, an orderly termination sequence must be controled via exceptions
# and signals.
#
# Alas, a number of core python errors makes this difficult to achieve.  Amongst
# them are:
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue24862 (08/2015)
#     processes can only be waited for by the parent process, which makes it
#     difficult to control process termination in a process tree if the process
#     chain gets interrupted, aven if the leaf PIDs are known.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue23395 (02/2015)
#     `SIGINT` signal handlers conflict with the *only* documented inter-thread
#     termination procedure `thread.interrupt_main()`.  This requires us to
#     either not handle `SIGINT`, or to find an alternative approach to thread
#     termination handling.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue21895 (07/2014)
#     several methods in python are not signal-interruptible, including
#     thread.join() and socket.select().  The reason is that those calls map to
#     libc level calls, but the CPython C-level signal handler is *not* directly
#     invoking the Python level signal handlers, but only sets a flag for later
#     handling.  That handling is supposed to happen at bytecode boundaries, ie.
#     after the any libc-call returns.
#
#     That could be circumvented by always using libc call equivalents with
#     a timeout.  Alas, that is not always possible -- for example, join() does
#     not have a timeout parameter.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue1856  (01/2008)
#     sys.exit can segfault Python if daemon threads are active.  This is fixed 
#     in python3, but will not be backported to 2.x, because...
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue21963 (07/2014)
#     ... it would hang up for daemon threads which don't ever re-acquire the
#     GIL.  That is not an issue for us - but alas, no backport thus.  So, we
#     need to make sure our watcher threads (which are daemons) terminate 
#     on their own.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue27889 (08/2016)
#     signals can not reliably be translated into exceptions, as the delayed
#     signal handling implies races on the exception handling.  A nested
#     exception loop seems to avoid that problem -- but that cannot be enforced
#     in application code or 3rd party modules (and is very cumbersome to
#     consistently apply throughout the code stack).
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue6634  (08/2009)
#     When called in a sub-thread, `sys.exit()` will, other than documented,
#     not exit the Python interpreter, nor will it (other than documented) print
#     any error to `stderr`.  The MainThread will not be notified of the exit
#     request.
#
#   - https://bugs.python.org/issue6642 (08/2009)
#     We can never fork in a sub-thread, as the fork will not clean out the
#     Python interpreter.
#
#
# Not errors, but expected behavior which makes life difficult:
#
#   - https://joeshaw.org/python-daemon-threads-considered-harmful/
#     Python's daemon threads can still be alive while the interpreter shuts
#     down.  The shutdown will remove all loaded modules -- which will lead to
#     the dreaded 
#       'AttributeError during shutdown -- can likely be ignored'
#     exceptions.  There seems no clean solution for that, but we can try to
#     catch & discard the exception in the watchers main loop (which possibly
#     masks real errors though).
#
#   - cpython's delayed signal handling can lead to signals being ignored when
#     they are translated into exceptions.
#     Assume this pseudo-code loop in a low-level 3rd party module:
# 
#     data = None
#     while not data:
#         try:
#             if fd.select(timeout):
#                 data = read(size)
#         except:
#             # select timed out - retry
#             pass
#
#     Due to the verly generous except clauses, a signal interrupting the select
#     would be interpreted as select timeout.  Those clauses *do* exist in
#     modules and core libs.
#     (This race is different from https://bugs.python.org/issue27889)
#
#   - a cpython-level API call exists to inject exceptions into other threads:
#
#       import ctypes
#       ctypes.pythonapi.PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc(ctypes.c_long(thread_id),
#                                                  ctypes.py_object(e))
#
#     Alas, almost the same problems apply as for signal handling: exceptions
#     thus inserted are interpreted delayed, and are thus prone to the same
#     races as signal handlers.  Further, they can easily get lost in
#     too-generous except clauses in low level modules and core libraries.
#     Further, unlike signals, they will not interrupt any libc calls.
#     That method is thus inferior to signal handling.
#
#   - mp.join() can miss starting child processes:
#     When start() is called, join can be called immediately after.  At that
#     point, the child may, however, not yet be alive, and join would *silently*
#     return immediately.  If between that failed join and process termination
#     the child process *actually* comes up, the process termination will hang,
#     as the child has not been waited upon.
#
#   - we actually can't really use fork() either, unless it is *immediately* (as
#     in *first call*) followed by an exec, because core python modules don't
#     free locks on fork.  We monkeypatch the logging module though and also
#     ensure unlock at-fork for our own stack, but the problem remains (zmq
#     comes to mind).
#     This problem could be addressed - but this is useless unless the other
#     problems are addressed, too (the problem applies to process-bootstrapping
#     only, and is quite easy to distinguish from other bugs / races).
#
# NOTE: For some GIL details, see http://www.dabeaz.com/python/GIL.pdf
#     This focuses on performance, but contains some details relevant to
#     signal handling.  Note this is from 2009, mentions that  GIL management
#     has not changed for the past 10 years.  It has not changed by now
#     either, FWIW.
#
#
# Bottom Line: We Can't Use:
# --------------------------
#
#   - signal handlers which raise exceptions
#   - exception injects into other threads
#   - thread.interrupt_main() in combination with SIGINT(CTRL-C) handlers
#   - daemon threads
#   - multiprocessing with a method target
#
#
# Chosen Approach
# ---------------
#
# We distinguish two termination 'directions' for each component: 
#
# i)  external, where a component's termination gets triggered by calling
#     `component.stop()` on the original component object instance.
#
# ii) internal, where a component's termination gets triggered from its main
#     thread, one of its sub-threads, or one of its child processes;
#
# Any external termination will ultimately trigger an internal one.
#
# Internal termination conditions need to be communicated to the component's
# MainThread.  This happens in one of two ways:
#
# sub-threads and child processes will terminate themself if they meet a 
# termination condition, and the MainThread will be notified by a thread
# and process watcherm (which itself is a sub-thread of the MainThread).
# Upon such a notification, the component's MainThread will raise an
# exception.
#
# TODO: clarify how termination causes are communicated to the main
#       thread, to include that information in the exception.
#
# Before the MainThread raises its exception, it communicates a termination
# command to (a) its remaining sub-threads, and (b) its remaining child 
# processes.
#
# a) a `mt.Event()` (`self._thread_term`) is set, and all threads are
#    `join()`ed
#    On timeout (default: 60s), a `SYSTEM_EXIT` exception is injected into
#    the sub-thread, and it is `join()`ed again.
#
# b) a `mp.Event()` (`self._proc_term`) is set, and all child processes are
#    `join()`ed.  
#    On timeout (default: 60s), a `SIGTERM` is sent to the child process,
#    and it is `join()`ed again.
#
# Despite the mentioned problems, we *must* install a `SIGTERM` signal handler,
# as SIGTERM will be used by the OS or middleware to communicate termination to
# the pilot agents.  Those signal handlers though cannot use exceptions, and
# will thus only set the termination events.  If the event is already set, the
# signal handler will invoke `os.exit()`
#
# NOTE: The timeout fallback mechanisms are error prone per discussion above,
#       and thus should only get triggered in exceptional circumstances.  No
#       guarantees can be made on overall clean termination in those cases!
#
#       This is complicated by the fact that we cannot (reliably) interrupt any
#       operation in sub-threads and child processes, so the wait for timeout
#       will also include the time until the terminee will discover the
#       termination request, which can be an arbitrary amount of time (consider
#       the child thread is transferring a large file).  It will be up to the
#       individual component implementations to try to mitigate this effect, and
#       to check for termination signals as frequently as possible.  
#
# NOTE: The timeout approach has a hierarchy problem: a child of a child of
#       a process is waited on for 60 seconds -- but at that point the
#       original process' `join()` will already have timed out, triggering
#       a hard termination of the intermediate child, thus skipping the
#       intermediate `join()`.  The timeout should thus take the hierarchy
#       depth into account.  
#       This is ignored for now, mainly because the depth of the hierarchy
#       is not communicated / known in all places.  The above mechanism will
#       thus only be able to handle at most one hierarchy layer of unclean
#       process or thread termination, and also only if thread and process
#       termination are triggered concurrently.

#
# Worker threads will work on random items, consuming between 1 and 90 seconds
# of time each.  The enumerated entities will raise exceptions after 2 minutes,
# if the environment variable `RU_RAISE_ON_<N>` is set to `1`, where `<N>` is
# the respecitve enumeration value.  An additional test is defined by pressing
# `CONTROL-C`.
#
# A test is considered successful when all of the following conditions apply:
#
#   - the resulting log files contain termination notifications for all entities
#   - the application catches a `RuntimeError('terminated')` exception or a
#     `KeyboardInterrupt` exception
#   - no processes or threads remain (also, no zombies)
