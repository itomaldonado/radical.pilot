class Component(mp.Process):
    """
    This class provides the basic structure for any RP component which operates
    on stateful things.  It provides means to:

      - define input channels on which to receive new things in certain states
      - define work methods which operate on the things to advance their state
      - define output channels to which to send the things after working on them
      - define notification channels over which messages with other components
        can be exchanged (publish/subscriber channels)

    All low level communication is handled by the base class -- deriving classes
    will register the respective channels, valid state transitions, and work
    methods.  When a 'thing' is received, the component is assumed to have full
    ownership over it, and that no other component will change the 'thing's
    state during that time.

    The main event loop of the component -- run() -- is executed as a separate
    process.  Components inheriting this class should be fully self sufficient,
    and should specifically attempt not to use shared resources.  That will
    ensure that multiple instances of the component can coexist for higher
    overall system throughput.  Should access to shared resources be necessary,
    it will require some locking mechanism across process boundaries.

    This approach should ensure that

      - 'thing's are always in a well defined state;
      - components are simple and focus on the semantics of 'thing' state
        progression;
      - no state races can occur on 'thing' state progression;
      - only valid state transitions can be enacted (given correct declaration
        of the component's semantics);
      - the overall system is performant and scalable.

    Inheriting classes may overload the methods:

        initialize
        initialize_child
        finalize
        finalize_child

    These method should be used to

      - set up the component state for operation
      - register input/output/notification channels
      - register work methods
      - register callbacks to be invoked on state notification
      - tear down the same on closing

    Inheriting classes MUST call the constructor:

        class StagingComponent(rpu.Component):
            def __init__(self, cfg, session):
                rpu.Component.__init__(self, cfg, session)

    Further, the class must implement the registered work methods, with
    a signature of:

        work(self, things)

    The method is expected to change the state of the 'thing's given.  'Thing's
    will not be pushed to outgoing channels automatically -- to do so, the work
    method has to call (see call documentation for other options):

        self.advance(thing)

    Until that method is called, the component is considered the sole owner of
    the 'thing's.  After that method is called, the 'thing's are considered
    disowned by the component.  If, however, components return from the work
    methods without calling advance on the given 'thing's, then the component
    keeps ownership of the 'thing's to advance it asynchronously at a later
    point in time.  That implies that a component can collect ownership over an
    arbitrary number of 'thing's over time, and they can be advanced at the
    component's descretion.

    NOTE: this class expects an unaltered name for the main thread 'MainThread'!

    #  - make state transitions more formal

    def __init__(self, cfg, session):
        """
        This constructor MUST be called by inheriting classes, as it specifies
        the operation mode of the component: components can spawn a child
        process, or not.

        If a child will be spawned later, then the child process state can be
        initialized by overloading the`initialize_child()` method.
        Initialization for component the parent process is similarly done via
        `initializale_parent()`, which will be called no matter if the component
        spawns a child or not.

        Note that this policy should be strictly followed by all derived
        classes, as we will otherwise carry state over the process fork.  That
        can become nasty if the state included any form of locking (like, for
        profiling or locking).

        The symmetric teardown methods are called `finalize_child()` and
        `finalize_parent()`, for child and parent process, repsectively.

        Constructors of inheriting components *may* call start() in their
        constructor.

        #       any state at this point.  As such, each child has to make

        This method will start the child process.  After doing so, it will
        call `initialize_parent()`, which is thus only executed in the
        parent's process context (because: after fork).  
        
        In the child process, `start()` will execute the run loop, and in that
        context will call `initialize_child()` (before entering the loop).

        Thus `start()` essentially performs:

            pid = fork()

            if pid:
                self._initialize_common()
                self._initialize_parent()

                self._initialize_common()
                self._initialize_child()
                run()

        This is not really correct though, as we don't have control over the
        fork itself (that happens in the base class).  So our implementation
        does:

        def run():
            self._initialize_common()
            self._initialize_child()
            ...

        which takes care of the child initialization, and here we take care of
        the parent initialization after we called the base class' `start()`
        method, ie. after fork.

        On child failures, we do nothing, and wait for the thread/process
        watcher tread to pick up any early process demise, to relay that fact to
        the parent process.  Errors in the parent code path
        (`initialize_common()` / `initialize_parent()` will fall through, it is
        the callee's responsibility to stop the child process by calling
        `self.stop()`.


        BOOTSTRAPPING
        -------------
        
        Before fork, the parent will create a multiprocessing.Queue instance,
        and pass it on to the child process.  The child process will, after
        initialization, send an 'ALIVE' message through that queue, and is then
        considered up and running.  The parent will block until that ALIVE
        message is received, so that the child process is, up, running, and
        initialized when `start()` returns.   

        In the case of child-initialization errors, the child will send an error
        message instead, and the parent will raise a `RuntimeError` with the
        respective message instead.  The parent will also fail after a 10 second
        timeout (start optionally accepts a different timeout argument though).
        Both child and parent will close the queue immediately after
        initialization.

        NOTE: The parent initialization will only start *before* the child's
              ALIVE message has been received.  `stop()` will be called on
              failed child startup.

        NOTE: Due to various problems with Python's threading, multiprocessing
              and signal handling, we can only start components from the main
              thread.

        Shut down the process hosting the event loop.  If the parent calls
        stop(), the child is terminated via SIGTERM, and the child process is
        responsible for finilization in its own scope, by installing a SIGTERM
        signal handler which calls `stop()` in the child context.

        NOTE: The child should *not* use `thread.interrupt_main()` 
              see http://bugs.python.org/issue23395

        When `stop()` is called from a sub-thread, it will raise a runtime error
        so that the thread exits.  We expect that thread termination to be
        caught by the mian thread (or at least to be communicated to the main
        thread) which then should invoke stop() itself.  Finalizers are thus
        only invoked in the main thread (just as initializers).

        It is in general important that all finalization steps are executed in
        reverse order of their initialization -- any deviation from that scheme
        should be carefully evaluated.  This specifically holds for the
        overloaded methods:

            - initialize_common / finalize_common
            - initialize_parent / finalize_parent
            - initialize_child  / finalize_child

        but also for their private counterparts defined in this base class.

        stop() basically performs:

            if parent:
                self.terminate()  # send SIGTERM to child

        # around the main loop -- the child's main thread should never have any
        # execute any code outside of those clauses, unless it it already
        # terminating anyway.

        #   - the user application.
        #
        # For the latter, we can't enforce a cumbersome nested try/except, so we
        # can't raise an exception [1].  In this case we thus partially
        # re-implement the functionality of the low level python signal
        # handling: sets a flag that the signal has been received, and then
        # opportunistically evaluate that flag in the main thread.
        #
        # toward the latter action, we provide a separate method
        # `_signal_checker` to raise the respective exception when called (which
        # thus id delayed from the time when the signal was received).  That
        # method should indirectly be called on all RP API calls -- all
        # components will thus register the signal checkers in the session, and
        # all API methods will need to make sure to ask the session for the
